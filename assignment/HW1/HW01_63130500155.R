#2.1 Create data structure in variable named marvel_movies and explain why you using this data structure ?
marvel_movie <- data.frame(names,years)

#2.2 Finding the information:
#2.2.1 The numbers of movies
length(names)

#2.2.2 Finding the 19th movies name
names[19]

#2.2.3 Which year is most released movies 
#(In this question can using observation data, not necessary to used command to find answer)
#From my observation the answer is : 2017 and 2021 both those years have 4 movies.
